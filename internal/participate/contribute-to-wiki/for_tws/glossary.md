# IOTA Word List

This article is a slab.

Whenever you use a technical term, check the [IOTA glossary](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/resource-materials/glossary) for the accepted notation. 

Whenever you encounter a term that is written in different ways across documentation, please propose a unified spelling and make a designated pull request that adds a new entry to the glossary and ideally replaces all occurrences of improper spelling in the wiki. That would help both us, writers, and our readers.
